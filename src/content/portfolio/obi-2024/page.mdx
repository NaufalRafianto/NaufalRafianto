  Following the success of the OBI ITS 2023 platform, the Olympiade of Biology ITS (OBI) 2024 required a more advanced
  solution to handle a greater number of participants and offer enhanced features. This year, I took on the challenge of
  building the entire full-stack platform by myself, handling both the frontend and backend development.

    The project leveraged **Next.js** for the frontend, utilizing its server-side rendering for SEO benefits and
    improved page loading speed. On the backend, I decided to use **Express.js** with **TypeScript** for better type
    safety and **MongoDB** for its scalability and flexibility in handling participant data. This was my first time
    building a full-stack project independently, from designing the user interface to managing the entire database and
    server logic.

  <h2 id="challenges-and-lessons-learned">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
  
  Creating the OBI ITS 2024 platform as a solo full-stack developer was an incredible learning experience. Since it was my first time working on both the frontend and backend completely on my own, I encountered numerous challenges, including:

{' '}

<Challenges
  challenges={[
    'Designing the architecture of the entire system, from the database to the API and frontend integration.',
    'Implementing user authentication and session management securely.',
    'Optimizing the backend to handle a growing number of participants efficiently using MongoDB.',
    'Managing both time and resources effectively to meet tight deadlines.',
  ]}
/>

One of the biggest lessons I learned was how to **balance frontend and backend responsibilities**. I needed to be flexible and strategic about when to focus on UI/UX improvements and when to dive into server logic. Debugging and testing were crucial to ensure everything worked seamlessly across both ends.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of full-stack development, particularly in working with **RESTful APIs**, database design, and **state management** in the frontend. I'm proud of how much I grew as a developer throughout this project.
