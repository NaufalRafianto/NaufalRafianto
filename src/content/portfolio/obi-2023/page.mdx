  The Olympiade of Biology ITS (OBI) 2023 brought together passionate young biologists from across Indonesia in a
  competition that tested both their knowledge and problem-solving skills. The event, which was hosted in a hybrid
  format, needed a digital platform to provide a seamless competition experience, facilitate registration, and manage
  event logistics through an intuitive user interface. I had the opportunity to lead the development team for this
  project.

    This project utilized a combination of Next.js and TailwindCSS on the frontend. Next.js was selected for its strong
    SEO capabilities and ease of routing, while TailwindCSS allowed us to rapidly prototype and create a responsive,
    visually appealing UI. The backend relied on Laravel for its stability, with Prisma and MySQL handling data
    management.

  <h2 id="challenges-and-lessons-learned">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
  
  Leading the development team for OBI ITS 2023 was both a rewarding and challenging experience. As my first paid project
  as a **lead developer**, I faced a steep learning curve, particularly around managing a team and balancing technical
  demands. Here are some of the key challenges and lessons learned during this project:

{' '}

<Challenges
  challenges={[
    'Leading a team for the first time, including project management and decision-making responsibilities.',
    'Designing and implementing a secure authentication system using JWT-based authorization.',
    'Coordinating frontend and backend development, ensuring seamless integration across various tech stacks.',
    'Managing time and pressure to deliver within tight deadlines.',
  ]}
/>

As a first-time lead developer, I often felt the weight of responsibility to ensure everything was running smoothly,
from architectural decisions to team collaboration. One of the most significant challenges was building a secure
dashboard with authentication—an area I hadn’t worked on before. Balancing coding tasks while overseeing the team
also taught me a lot about communication and the importance of clear expectations.

Despite the challenges, the project was completed successfully within a month. I emerged from this experience with
enhanced problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of **team leadership**, time management, and technical execution.
