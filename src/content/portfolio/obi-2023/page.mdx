<FadeUp>
  Embarking on my first paid project as a lead developer was a journey filled with challenges and invaluable lessons.
  The task of building a website from scratch was daunting, particularly when it came to developing a secure dashboard
  with JWT-based authentication and authorizationâ€”something I had never tackled before. Despite these hurdles, I
  successfully completed the project within a month, gaining crucial skills and resilience that will benefit my future
  endeavors.
