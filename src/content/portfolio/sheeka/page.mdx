  <p>
    The Sheeka website was developed as part of a strategic initiative to showcase the brand and its innovative product
    line while competing in the prestigious Liga PKM. With an emphasis on both user experience and aesthetic design,
    this platform is a key digital asset that supports Sheeka's market presence and promotional activities during the
    competition.

  <h2 id="project-objectives">Project Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The primary goal of this project was to build an engaging and functional platform that could effectively display
    Sheeka’s products and guide users through seamless navigation. The landing page serves as a hub, with individual
    product pages that connect users to multiple marketplaces, thus expanding Sheeka's digital reach.

  <h2 id="tech-stack-used">Tech Stack Used</h2>
  <p>
    Sheeka's website was built using modern tools and frameworks to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience
    across all devices. Here’s the tech stack that powered the project:
  </p>
  <div className="not-prose mt-2">
    <TechIcon Tech={['nextjs', 'tailwind']} IconSize="h-14 w-14" />
  </div>
  <p>
    <strong>Next.js</strong> was chosen for its powerful server-side rendering and SEO capabilities, making the website
    faster and more visible in search engines. <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> enabled the rapid development of responsive
    and visually consistent UI components.

  <h2 id="challenges-and-solutions">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
  <p>
    While building the Sheeka website, one of the most significant challenges was ensuring that image ornaments and
    design elements looked consistent across various screen sizes. Different devices sometimes rendered images
    unpredictably, which required precise media queries and testing across multiple platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    To solve this, we optimized the image handling by using responsive design techniques and ensuring all visual
    elements adapted smoothly across resolutions, maintaining a consistent look on both mobile and desktop.
