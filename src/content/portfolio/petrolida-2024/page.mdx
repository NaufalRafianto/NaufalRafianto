  <h2 id="challenges-and-lessons-learned">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
  Stepping into the role of a website developer for events was a new experience for me. Initially, I had never worked
  with **TypeScript**. While I was initially overwhelmed by its complexity, my determination and fighting spirit enabled
  me to learn and now work with **TypeScript** without hesitation. Additionally, state management and API fetching were
  concepts I had not encountered before. Through diligent effort, I gradually mastered these concepts, leveraging
  YouTube tutorials to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills.
  <Challenges
    challenges={[
      'Mastering TypeScript from scratch',
      'Conquering state management complexities',
      'Navigating the intricacies of API fetching',
