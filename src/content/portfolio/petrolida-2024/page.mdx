  Petroleum Integrated Days (PETROLIDA) is the largest annual event organized by the SPE ITS Student Chapter. This
  year's series will be the 10th annual event. Petroleum Integrated Days mainly focus on various competitions in the
  energy sector but also provide non-competition events. PETROLIDA 2024 aims to serve as a platform for university
  students to explore and showcase their innovations regarding todayâ€™s energy challenges by providing them a chance to
  gain valuable and competitive experiences to advance their excellence.

  The main goal of this project was to create a dynamic and user-friendly website that serves as a central hub for
  PETROLIDA events. The website offers a seamless experience for both attendees and organizers, showcasing current
  events with comprehensive details, providing a captivating gallery of past events, and facilitating hassle-free ticket
  and merchandise sales through secure payment gateways. All of this was done while prioritizing an aesthetically
  pleasing and responsive design to foster a thriving community of users, connecting them with their favorite events and
  enhancing their overall experience.

    This project was built using Next.js and TailwindCSS for the frontend. The choice of Next.js was driven by its
    strong SEO capabilities and efficient routing, while TailwindCSS provided an efficient approach to styling, enabling
    rapid and responsive design development.

  <h2 id="challenges-and-lessons-learned">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
  Stepping into the role of a website developer for events was a new experience for me. Initially, I had never worked
  with **TypeScript**. While I was initially overwhelmed by its complexity, my determination and fighting spirit enabled
  me to learn and now work with **TypeScript** without hesitation. Additionally, state management and API fetching were
  concepts I had not encountered before. Through diligent effort, I gradually mastered these concepts, leveraging
  YouTube tutorials to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills.
