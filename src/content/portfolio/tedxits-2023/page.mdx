    This project was created using Next.js and TailwindCSS for the frontend. The choice of Next.js was motivated by its
    powerful SEO capabilities and efficient routing, while TailwindCSS provided a streamlined approach to styling,
    enabling rapid and responsive design development.

  <h2 id="challenges-and-lessons-learned">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
  Stepping into the role of a website developer for events was a novel experience for me. Initially, I had never worked with **TypeScript**. While I was initially overwhelmed by its complexity, my determination and fighting spirit enabled me to learn and now work with **TypeScript** without hesitation.

Additionally, state management and API fetching were concepts I had not encountered before. Through diligent effort, I gradually mastered these concepts, leveraging YouTube tutorials to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills.

<Challenges
  challenges={[
    'Mastering TypeScript from scratch',
    'Implementing effective state management',
    'Learning and applying API fetching techniques',
    'Balancing aesthetics with functionality in web design',
  ]}
/>
